## Tasks
As a tester, I needed to perform:
1. Working with the requirements for the Urban Lunch mobile app. 
2. Creating a [checklist](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1EmdMfCnx_kMGxtatgl4rpvJB0f37WWQRjxPv9pcE2gM/edit?usp=sharing) for testing the Urban Lunch app.
3. Testing the mobile app in the emulator.
4. Creating [bug reports](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Zjct2bb5toIwtmkEa5XXl8sAFnve2VSwc0GH0ILjy-M/edit?usp=sharing) in Jira. 
5. Writing a test report. 

## Findings
The application functions as intended, with most core features working correctly. However, several critical navigation, information display, and order processing issues require attention.
In my test report, I highlighted several key areas for improvement:
- Fix UI/UX navigation issues (pickup points order, dish details screen).
- Ensure complete and correct data display (restaurant names, cooking time, delivery cost).
- Improve post-order handling (redirect to new order process, map accuracy).
- Clarify error messages and feedback elements to provide a better user experience.
