**Skills:**
- Android Studio
- Mobile Application Testing
- Jira
- Test Design

## Overview
The [Urban Lunch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0n95FT2YMgU) is an Android app that allows customers to order meals from different restaurants in the city, and then collect them from one of the pickup points. 

## Tasks
As a tester, I needed to perform:
1. Working with the requirements for the Urban Lunch mobile app. 
2. Creating a [checklist](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1EmdMfCnx_kMGxtatgl4rpvJB0f37WWQRjxPv9pcE2gM/edit?usp=sharing) for testing the Urban Lunch app.
3. Testing the mobile app in the emulator.
4. Creating [bug reports](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Zjct2bb5toIwtmkEa5XXl8sAFnve2VSwc0GH0ILjy-M/edit?usp=sharing) in Jira. 
5. Writing a test report. 

## Findings
The application largely functions as intended, with most core features working correctly. However, there are several critical issues related to navigation, display of information, and order processing that require attention.
In my test report I highlighted several key areas for improvement:
- Fix UI/UX navigation issues (pick-up points order, dish details screen).
- Ensure complete and correct data display (restaurant names, cooking time, delivery cost).
- Improve post-order handling (redirect to new order process, map accuracy).
- Clarify error messages and feedback elements to provide better user experience.
